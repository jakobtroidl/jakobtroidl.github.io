I am a Ph. D. candidate in computer science at **[Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/)**, advised by **[Hanspeter Pfister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanspeter_Pfister)**.
I am broadly interested in **data visualization** and **applied machine learning**, especially with applications in **computational neuroscience**. Specifically, my research focuses on building scalable interactive visual analysis tools and representation learning approaches to analyze the hidden architecture of the brain. Currently, I am working with **[Srini Turaga](https://www.janelia.org/lab/turaga-lab)** at **[HHMI Janelia](https://www.janelia.org/)** as a visiting researcher.

I hold a M. Sc. in visual computing from **[TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/)**, Austria and a B. Sc. (with Honors) in medical informatics from the same university.
I was born and raised in the beautiful town of **[Regensburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regensburg)** in Germany. On the side, I am a member of **[beetsbook.club](https://beetsbook.club/)**.
