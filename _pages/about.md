I completed my Ph. D. in Computer Science at **[Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/)**, where I was advised by **[Hanspeter Pfister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanspeter_Pfister)**. Previously, I was working with **[Srini Turaga](https://www.janelia.org/lab/turaga-lab)** at **[HHMI Janelia](https://www.janelia.org/)** as a visiting researcher and as a ML Fellow at **[E11.bio](https://e11.bio/)**. I received my M. Sc. and B. Sc. degrees in Computer Science from **[TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/)**, Austria. I was born and raised in the beautiful town of **[Regensburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regensburg)** in Germany.

My research interests lie broadly in **applied machine learning** and **data visualization**, especially with applications in **neuroscience**. Specifically, my research focuses on building scalable interactive visual analysis tools and representation learning approaches to analyze the hidden architecture of the brain.
