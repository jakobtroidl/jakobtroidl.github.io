I am a Ph. D. candidate in Computer Science at **[Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/)**, advised by **[Hanspeter Pfister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanspeter_Pfister)**. I am broadly interested in **applied machine learning** and **data visualization**, especially with applications in **biology**. Specifically, my research focuses on building scalable interactive visual analysis tools and representation learning approaches to analyze the hidden architecture of the brain. Currently, I am working with **[Srini Turaga](https://www.janelia.org/lab/turaga-lab)** at **[HHMI Janelia](https://www.janelia.org/)** as a visiting researcher. Also, I am a ML Fellow at **[E11.bio](https://e11.bio/)** this summer.

I received my M. Sc. and B. Sc. in Computer Science from **[TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/)**, Austria. I was born and raised in the beautiful town of **[Regensburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regensburg)** in Germany. On the side, I am a member of **[beetsbook.club](https://beetsbook.club/)**.
